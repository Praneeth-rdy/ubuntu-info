** To create a react app you need nodejs installed in your machine
** react is a LIBRARY and NOT A FRAMEWORK. react is used to build UI and can be integrated with many technologies and at any part of your application

1) To create a react application: 'npx create-react-app <appname>'
(create-react-app is a node package which can be installed globally but instead of installing it globally,
using it with npx will help in using the latest version of create-react-app instead of always updating it manually)
2) This will create the project dir with <appname> mentioned which contains all the necessary files.
3) Now you can cd into that directory and run several commands:
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd myapp
  npm start

***********OR************
1) Go to base dir where you want to create your project(dir) and enter in terminal: 'npm init react-app <app-name>'
2) Now your react app is created. Do 'cd <app-name>' and then 'npm start' to run the application



*** Now to deploy it on gh-pages
1) 'npm install gh-pages --save-dev' to save it as a dev dependency
2) Now in package.json add '"homepage": "<The github page where you want to deploy the code>"'
3) Make sure that gh-pages package is added in devDependencies of the project's package.json.
4) Now, add two scripts in package.json: '"predeploy": "npm run build"' and '"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"'
5) Now configure this as a local git repo and make your required commits
6) Now 'npm run deploy'
7) Now 'git push -u origin main'

** You can use JSX(JavaScript XML) which is similar to XML or html in frontend. 
You can either use React library to create components like React.createElement() but JSX is recommended.
Even if we aren't using React library in the code, we should import it because JSX translates to react elements which in-turn uses React library.

JSX differences:
Class -> className
for -> htmlFor (similar to that of properties in conventional js)
camelCase property naming convention
onclick -> onClick
tabindex -> tabIndex

** Component props are immutable. To keep track of changing properties, use state. (see props vs state)
use this.setState(newState) to change the state
if you directly change state using this.state.params = new_params, then the state will be changed but won't be set to the UI(i.e. won't re-render)
** use this.state only in constructor not in any other place. use this.setState() in every other places.
** use callback functions if you want to perform certain operations after an async function executes.
Example, setState method is async so if you want to print something after its execution then use a callback function which will be passed as an argument to setState.



** When you host a react application on github with react routing, 
add the 404.html which is present in this base dir to the public folder of the project.
So that, when there is a force reload on a certain path server returns this 404.html,
which in turn, redirects to the necessary react route.
