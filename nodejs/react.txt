** To create a react app you need nodejs installed in your machine
** react is a LIBRARY and NOT A FRAMEWORK. react is used to build UI and can be integrated with many technologies and at any part of your application

1) To create a react application: 'npx create-react-app <appname>'
(create-react-app is a node package which can be installed globally but instead of installing it globally,
using it with npx will help in using the latest version of create-react-app instead of always updating it manually)
2) This will create the project dir with <appname> mentioned which contains all the necessary files.
3) Now you can cd into that directory and run several commands:
  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd myapp
  npm start
