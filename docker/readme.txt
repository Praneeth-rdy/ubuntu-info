** To experiment/play with docker without installation, go to 'https://labs.play-with-docker.com/'

** To uninstall the older versions use the command 'sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc'

- Itâ€™s OK if apt-get reports that none of these packages are installed.
- The contents of /var/lib/docker/, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, are preserved.
- If you do not need to save your existing data, and want to start with a clean installation,
    - Uninstall the Docker Engine, CLI, and Containerd packages: 'sudo apt-get purge docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io'
    - Images, containers, volumes, or customized configuration files on your host are not automatically removed. To delete all images, containers, and volumes:
        'sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker' and 'sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd'
    - You must delete any edited configuration files manually.


** Installing Docker using installation script
1) To download the installation script 'curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh'
2) To run the script 'sudo sh ./get-docker.sh' (DRY_RUN=1 option to learn what steps the script will execute during installation)

** Visit docker hub to install the existing public repositories of many images at 'https://hub.docker.com/'

** Errors
1) If you get an error 'E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)' during the installation use command 'sudo dpkg --configure -a'
This reconfigures the unpacked packages that were not installed during the installation process.


** If you would like to use docker as a non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the 'docker' group with something like 'sudo usermod -aG docker your-user'
Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect

** My first docker use while creating an OS kernel
1) Create a Dockerfile
2) Run 'docker build' to build the image
3) Run 'docker run' to create a docker container

** Docker Architecture
- Docker file creates Docker Image. Docker Image is a blueprint of the project.
- You can create your own docker images and publish them to docker hub or store in your local registry. Docker hub is also a registry.
- You can also pull the publicly available docker images into your local machine. These are readonly templates used to create containers.
- Docker container is an instance of Docker Image. This can be built from one or more docker images.
- Running docker image creates docker containers.
- Docker containers store the application along with all the dependencies (contains everything needed to run the application).
- You can create as many docker containers as you want using a docker image.

- Docker Engine will have client(docker-cli) and server (docker daemon or docker-d). In our case, both on same machine.
Docker cli interacts with server (docker daemon or docker-d) through a rest api. All the commands like pull, run, rm goes to the server.
- This manages container, images, network and data volumes

** Docker commands
1) To list the running containers: 'docker ps'
2) To list all the containers: 'docker ps -a'
3) To list the images 'docker image ls' or 'docker images'
4) To remove the docker image: 'docker rmi <image-id>'
5) To remove the docker container: 'docker rm <container-id>'
6) To pull the image: 'docker image pull <image-name>' or 'docker image pull <image-name>:latest'
7) To run the image: 'docker run <image-name>'
8) 'docker run -it <image>:tag <command-to-run> <arguments(optional)>'
(ex: docker run -it 4e5021d210f6 /bin/bash)(The -it instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the container's stdin; creating an interactive bash shell in the container.)
