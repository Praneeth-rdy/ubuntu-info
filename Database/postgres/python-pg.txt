We will use psycopg2 driver here.

Arguments required to connect PostgreSQL database from python:
1) Username of the PostgreSQL database. Default for PostgreSQL database is Postgres.
2) Password - This is given by the user at the time installing PostgreSQL.
3) Host Name - This is the server name or IP address on which PostgreSQL is running.
4) Database Name - Database name to which you want to connect.

Top level to Low level: Host Name > Database Name > Username==Password.


Steps:
1) Use the connect() method of psycopg2 with required arguments to connect PostgreSQL.
2) Create a cursor object using the connection object returned by the connect method to execute PostgreSQL queries from Python.
3) Close the Cursor object and PostgreSQL database connection after your work completes.
4) Catch Exception if any that may occur during this process
We mostly work with cursor objects when working with SQLite, PostgreSQL Databases.
