To solve this 'Waiting for another flutter command to release the startup lock...' on vscode when I run flutter doctor => I deleted the flutter/bin/cache/lockfile

Error: Could not initialize class org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.InvokerHelper
Solution: Open gradle-wrapper.properties in project dir gradle/wrapper/. Then replace the version number of gradle with a compatible one. (mostly a latest version)
